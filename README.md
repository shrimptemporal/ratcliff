# Ratcliff Estate

This is the working repo for Ratcliff Estate.

## HOW TO SET UP SSH:

- go to "optional features" under "apps and features" in windows settings
- if "openSSH client" is not in that list, click the + at the top and add it
- run the attached script (look in Mattermost or ping Gus) (only works on Windows)
- go to your Github Account Settings > SSH and GPG keys > "New SSH Key"
- type the name you remember this computer by into the name (whatever you want to call it)
- paste the SSH Key the script made into the big box
- hit "add SSH key"
- you now can push to GitHub from this computer (MAKE SURE YOU CLONE THE REPO WITH SSH NOT HTTPS)
- unfortunately you need to do this on every computer you work on, but you only need to do it once per computer

## HOW TO CLONE THE REPO:

- copy the !!! SSH LINK !!! NOT THE HTTPS LINK
- clone using whatever tool you want. if you use GitKraken you might need to check "use local SSH agent" or something like that
